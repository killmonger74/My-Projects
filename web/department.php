							<div class="about">
							<p>Of the many engineering disciplines, Mechanical Engineering is the broadest, encompassing a wide variety of engineering fields and many specialties. The mechanical engineers are employed in an enormous range of technical areas including: acoustics, air-conditioning, automatic controls, computer-aided design, energy management, fluid dynamics, robotics, biomechanics and turbo machinery, just to name a few. Mechanical engineering is a challenging, rewarding and highly respected profession.

The department of Mechanical Engineering at IT Gopeshwar with its commitment to excellence educates the engineers of tomorrow by integrating classroom theory and practical hands-on projects, and also by emphasizing the process of learning and critical thinking by conducting industrial visits.

The teaching and research programs in the department are organized according to both disciplinary and inter-disciplinary themes. We cover all the core disciplinary areas of Mechanical Engineering including dynamics, controls, solid mechanics, materials, fluid mechanics, thermodynamics, automobile and design</p> </div>
